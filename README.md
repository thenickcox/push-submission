# Greetings, Push.

Thanks for your consideration. I've created a solution to your code assessment, found in `demo.js`. You can view a live version [here](http://jsbin.com/hojoyuyipi/1/edit?js,output). I chose jsBin to avoid configuring Webpack for this one small file. However, I wanted to include this version of the code to give you a better sense of my workflow (es6/babel/eslint, etc.).

Thank you again for taking the time to review this submission. I'll look forward to hearing from you soon!

Sincerely,
Nick
